Firmware:
    * add a last reboot reason to statistics page
    * try to get https working again
        * https://github.com/Bmooij/AsyncTCP-https-server-example
        * https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer/issues/1183
        * https://github.com/yubox-node-org/AsyncTCPSock
        * possible switch to https://github.com/fhessel/esp32_https_server
        * look again at the espressif server: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/protocols/esp_https_server.html
            * https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/protocols/https_server/wss_server
    * find in signalk app where it sends the discovery info to mfd's and see if we can copy?
        * I think the magic happens here: https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server/blob/master/src/interfaces/mfd_webapp.ts
    * protocol documentation
    * learn about building components for node-red, maybe make a yarrboard toolkit

8ch MOSFET:
    * remove CAN port - never going to use it.
    * change fan2 tach to pin 4
    * combine fan 1 pwm and fan 2 pwm to pin 16
    * add voltage detector to each channel for run detection - another mcp3208 + bus voltage divider circuit
    * maybe switch to "pcb welding terminal" connection like 74650073R or C5370858 or C3029538
        * or at least a 9.5mm pitch barrier terminal like C496131 or C430699 or C430687 or C707586
    * move to 4 layer design signal / gnd / gnd / signal

RGB Input:
    * move to 4 layer design signal / gnd / gnd / signal

Electronics:
    * update 3dp case for 8ch mosfet
    * design case for input board
    * design case for button board

Long Term Maybe?
    * Relay board - DC or AC?
    * Motor driver / H bridge?

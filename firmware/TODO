Firmware:

* convert Adafruit LED library to hardware SPI
* protocol documentation
* learn about building components for node-red, maybe make a yarrboard toolkit

8ch MOSFET:

* remove CAN port - never going to use it.
* change fan2 tach to pin 4
* combine fan 1 pwm and fan 2 pwm to pin 16
* add voltage detector to each channel for run detection - another mcp3208 + bus voltage divider circuit
* maybe switch to "pcb welding terminal" connection like 74650073R or C5370858 or C3029538
    * or at least a 9.5mm pitch barrier terminal like C496131 or C430699 or C430687 or C707586

Electronics:

* update 3dp case for 8ch mosfet
* design case for input board
* design case for button board
* move boards to 4 layer design signal / gnd / gnd / signal

Long term:

* reinvestigate firmware signing

Other Useful Boards:

* Relay board - DC or AC?
* Motor driver / H bridge?

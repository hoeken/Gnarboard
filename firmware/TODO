Firmware:

* change the way we are handling success/error/ok messages
* change message parsing to use FIFO
* refactor channel into an object
* break yarrboard-client into own npm module
* protocol documentation
* stability fixes as needed

Electronics:

* test qwiic
* move esp32 to front of board for usb access
* change 24v on R3/D18 to after fuse (no via needed)

Case Design:

* add breakaway tabs
* design power post cover w/ breakaway tabs
* add Gnarboard logo / text
* add +/- signs over busbars
* add overlap to top cover

Long term:

* add in reset reason: https://espressif-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/api/reset_reason.html
* ledc fade: https://gist.github.com/CelliesProjects/71dac9b77fd49c598434c8be32dd03d9
* make a channel struct and use that instaed of 10 different arrays
* reinvestigate firmware signing
* figure out how to do safe update with spiffs (2 partitions?)
* can we get the code smaller?
    * refactor to remove Arduino dependency?
* N2K support

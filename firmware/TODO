Firmware:

* protocol documentation

Electronics:

* test small mosfet
* test new mosfet
* test MCP3221 + busvoltage
* test new driver chip
* test qwiic
* move esp32 to front of board for usb access
* change 24v on R3/D18 to after fuse (no via needed)

Case:

* add zip tie mounts to top

Long term:

* reinvestigate firmware signing
* figure out how to do safe update with spiffs (2 partitions?)
* can we get the code smaller?
    * refactor to remove Arduino dependency?
* N2K support

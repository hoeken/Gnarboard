Firmware:

* update ADC code to do averaging every time message is sent out, not during reading.
* protocol documentation

Electronics:

* move esp32 to front of board for usb access
* test MCP3221 + busvoltage
* test new driver chip

Case:

* add zip tie mounts to top

Long term:

* reinvestigate firmware signing
* figure out how to do safe update with spiffs (2 partitions?)
* can we get the code smaller?
    * refactor to remove Arduino dependency?
* N2K support

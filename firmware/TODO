* update for 8ch mosfet Rev B
    * 2 fans now
* protocol documentation
* add uptime to signalk integration

Electronics:

* 8ch Mosfet
    * 2N7002 missing p/n
    * noise on current measurement?
    * MCP3425 doesnt need precision vref?
    * consolidate 10nF / 50v cap

* RGB board
    * add in bus voltage measurement?
    * pin GPIO12 - output only, swap with other pin. (GPIO17?)
    * pin GPIO2 - needs low @ boot, swap with other pin (GPIO15?)
    * precision 5v ref needs to be powered from ESP32_5V
    * consolidate 10nF / 50v cap
    * add in BLANK line
    * switch to external I/O expander
    * move led drivers to secondary SPI bus

* finish design of button board

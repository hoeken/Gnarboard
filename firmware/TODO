Firmware:

* refactor to group pages by login required
* refactor all the channel config into a single command
* json over serial should be an app option (default on)
* json api should be an app option (default on)
* refactor again to have objects pass the ArduinoJson instead of passing in the buffer.
* breakup the app and network config into separate pages

* protocol documentation
* stability fixes as needed

Electronics:

* test qwiic

Long term:

* reinvestigate firmware signing
* figure out how to do safe update with spiffs (2 partitions?)
* can we get the code smaller?
    * refactor to remove Arduino dependency?
* control via N2K bus

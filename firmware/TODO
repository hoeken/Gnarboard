Firmware:

* add uptime to signalk integration?

* update for 8ch mosfet Rev B
    * 2 fans now
    * bus voltage from MCP3425
* update for input board
    * board config
        * adc inputs
        * digital inputs
        * rgb outputs
    * update web app to handle new board
        * adc inputs
        * digital inputs
        * rgb outputs
    * write code for LED driver
    * digital input debounce
* protocol documentation

* look into integrating the FS into the binary
    * maybe https://github.com/jkent/frogfs
    * maybe this way? https://esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=29875
    * this might be easiest: https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/platforms/espressif32.html#embedding-binary-data
        * change to small spiffs partition: https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/tools/partitions/min_spiffs.csv
        * automatically gzip files: https://community.platformio.org/t/question-esp32-compress-files-in-data-to-gzip-before-upload-possible-to-spiffs/6274/14
        * or possibly use gulp: https://tinkerman.cat/post/optimizing-files-for-spiffs-with-gulp/
        * https://tinkerman.cat/post/embed-your-website-in-your-esp8266-firmware-image/
        * gulp looks nice since we can compress every thing into one file or at least html + css + js + images and use modified date for caching.

Electronics:

* finish design of button board
* order button board + parts
* update 3dp case for 8ch mosfet
* design case for input board
* design case for button board

Long term:

* reinvestigate firmware signing
* figure out how to do safe update with spiffs (2 partitions?)
* can we get the code smaller?
    * refactor to remove Arduino dependency?
* N2K support

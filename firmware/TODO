Firmware:

* protocol documentation
* investigate mongoose: https://mongoose.ws/documentation/tutorials/esp32/device-dashboard
    * https://github.com/jeremypoulter/ArduinoMongoose

Electronics:

* change i2c back to qwiic r/a header (part?)
* move i2c to underneath the esp32
* confirm part numbers on all parts
* order pcb

Long term:

* reinvestigate firmware signing
* figure out how to do safe update with spiffs (2 partitions?)
* can we get the code smaller?
    * refactor to remove Arduino dependency?
* N2K support

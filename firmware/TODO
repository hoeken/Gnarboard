Firmware:

* setting fade or duty cycle to 0 shouldn't save it in that mode
* don't save duty cycle at the very beginning of a fade.
* protocol documentation

Electronics:

* move esp32 to front of board for usb access
* test MCP3221 + busvoltage
* test new driver chip

Case:

* add zip tie mounts to top

Long term:

* reinvestigate firmware signing
* figure out how to do safe update with spiffs (2 partitions?)
* can we get the code smaller?
    * refactor to remove Arduino dependency?
* N2K support

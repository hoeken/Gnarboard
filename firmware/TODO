Firmware:

* refactor to have objects pass the ArduinoJson instead of passing in the buffer.
    * make sure we are using arduinojson properly and not making a ton of copies

* refactor channel into an object

* add msgid global parameter and return it in our messages.

* protocol documentation
* stability fixes as needed

Electronics:

* test qwiic
* move esp32 to front of board for usb access
* change 24v on R3/D18 to after fuse (no via needed)
* 

Long term:

* add in reset reason: https://espressif-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/api/reset_reason.html
* ledc fade: https://gist.github.com/CelliesProjects/71dac9b77fd49c598434c8be32dd03d9
* make a channel struct and use that instaed of 10 different arrays
* reinvestigate firmware signing
* figure out how to do safe update with spiffs (2 partitions?)
* can we get the code smaller?
    * refactor to remove Arduino dependency?
* N2K support

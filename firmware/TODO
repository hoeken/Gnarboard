Firmware:

* add fan pwm and tach stuff.
* figure out how to split the code into different files.

Electronics:

* tweak resistors on the mosfet driver
* test different diode for 5v supply
* test qwiic

Long term:

* test firmware signing
* figure out how to do safe update with spiffs (2 partitions?)
* give ledcwrite and higher res pwm another chance
* some sort of POST/GET method for toggling pin state
* GET page for board status / config / stats / etc
* send/receive json over serial as well
* control via N2K bus

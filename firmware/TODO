Firmware:

* add a toggle_channel command
* refactor to have objects pass the ArduinoJson instead of passing in the buffer.
    * make sure we are using arduinojson properly and not making a ton of copies

* protocol documentation
* stability fixes as needed

Electronics:

* test qwiic

Long term:

* reinvestigate firmware signing
* figure out how to do safe update with spiffs (2 partitions?)
* can we get the code smaller?
    * refactor to remove Arduino dependency?
* N2K support

Case Design:

* spacers should through bolt from bottom of board
* make walls thicker (2mm?)
*

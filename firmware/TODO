Firmware:

* protocol documentation

Electronics:

* push mosfet and other passives towards top of the board away from acs725
* test MCP3221 + busvoltage
* test new driver chip
* fix center point of fuse holder

Long term:

* reinvestigate firmware signing
* figure out how to do safe update with spiffs (2 partitions?)
* can we get the code smaller?
    * refactor to remove Arduino dependency?
* N2K support

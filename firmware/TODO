Firmware:

* protocol documentation

Electronics:

* test qwiic
* move esp32 to front of board for usb access
* change 24v on R3/D18 to after fuse (no via needed)

Case Design:

* add breakaway tabs
* design power post cover w/ breakaway tabs
* add Gnarboard logo / text
* add +/- signs over busbars
* add overlap to top cover

Long term:

* reinvestigate firmware signing
* figure out how to do safe update with spiffs (2 partitions?)
* can we get the code smaller?
    * refactor to remove Arduino dependency?
* N2K support

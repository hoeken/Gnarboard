Firmware:

* documentation
* stability fixes

Electronics:

* test qwiic

Long term:

* GET page for board status / config / stats / etc
* reinvestigate firmware signing
* figure out how to do safe update with spiffs (2 partitions?)
* some sort of POST/GET method for toggling pin state (how to deal with login / auth)
* send/receive json over serial
* control via N2K bus
* refactor to remove Arduino dependency? (can we get the code smaller?)

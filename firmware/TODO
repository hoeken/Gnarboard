Firmware:

* reconnecting / reloading on status page should trigger status poller
* update node.js client
* update signalk plugin
    * add uptime to signalk integration
* convert Adafruit library to hardware SPI
* protocol documentation

Electronics:

* 8ch Mosfet Board
    * test and implement mosfet changes
    * re-layout board
    * mosfet driver potentials:
        * VOM1271 (might be too slow?)
        * MIC5011 - $5/ea
        * MIC5013 - $4/ea
        * MIC5021 - $3 / ea - high speed, might be too extra w/ current sense?
        * TC4432 - $2.5 / ea - looks decent
    * n-channel mosfet: IPD220N06L3GATMA1

* RGB Input Board
    * run ERC / DRC and fix all errors
    * double check schematic
    * update silkscreen and make board pretty
    * release for prototyping
    * tag in github

* Button Board
    * change to FPC connectors
    * change to 2x4 layout
    * do all routing
    * order prototypes

* update 3dp case for 8ch mosfet
* design case for input board
* design case for button board

Long term:

* reinvestigate firmware signing
* N2K support
* design a relay board

Firmware:

* protocol documentation

Electronics:

* test MCP3221 + busvoltage
* test new driver chip
* fix silkscreen
* confirm part numbers on all parts
* add test points
* order pcb

Long term:

* reinvestigate firmware signing
* figure out how to do safe update with spiffs (2 partitions?)
* can we get the code smaller?
    * refactor to remove Arduino dependency?
* N2K support

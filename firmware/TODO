Firmware:

* refactor to move pages to login required or not.
* refactor all the channel config into a single command
* send/receive json over serial
* refactor again to have objects pass the ArduinoJson instead of passing in the buffer.

* documentation
* stability fixes

Electronics:

* test qwiic

Long term:

* reinvestigate firmware signing
* figure out how to do safe update with spiffs (2 partitions?)
* control via N2K bus
* refactor to remove Arduino dependency? (can we get the code smaller?)

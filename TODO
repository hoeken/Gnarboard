Code:

* implement external ADC
* allow turning off of duty cycle memory (per channel?)
* check current against soft fuse
* more error checking of input
* would be nice to revisit the webserver w/ a simple UI for config and control of the board.
* would be nice to have a way of setting up the wifi: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-wi-fi-manager-asyncwebserver/
* leave the gate open for N2K compatability: https://github.com/AK-Homberger/ESP32-Evo-Remote-Pilot-NMEA2000/blob/master/ESP32EvoPilotRemote/ESP32EvoPilotRemote.ino

Electronics:

* test code with leds on all pins
* test breadboarded mosfet circuit - opto vs npn transistor
* test and decide on ADC
* test and decide on current sensor
* start schematic and pcb design
	* add a row of breakout headers for testing
	* do we have room for digital inputs?

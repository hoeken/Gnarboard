Code:

* new connection should only have config message sent to it, not all.
* add ability to toggle on/off
* add ability to set duty cycle
* add ability to name channels
* make it look better
* add ability to change board name
* wifi credential setup: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-wi-fi-manager-asyncwebserver/
* choose current measurement IC
* more error checking of input

Long Term:

* add OTA update functionality: https://lastminuteengineers.com/esp32-ota-web-updater-arduino-ide/
* why does ledcwrite not work properly?
* leave the gate open for N2K compatability: https://github.com/AK-Homberger/ESP32-Evo-Remote-Pilot-NMEA2000/blob/master/ESP32EvoPilotRemote/ESP32EvoPilotRemote.ino

Electronics:

* test voltage divider to get bus voltage
* test code with leds on all pins
* test breadboarded mosfet circuit - opto vs npn transistor
* test and decide on current sensor
* start schematic and pcb design
  * add a row of breakout headers for testing
  * figure out if there's a common i2c and spi header
  * add a header for serial port
  * any i/o pins left over?

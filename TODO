Code:

* implement external ADC
* check current against soft fuse
* more error checking of input

Electronics:

* test code with leds on all pins
* test breadboarded mosfet circuit - opto vs npn transistor
* test and decide on ADC
* test and decide on current sensor
* start schematic and pcb design

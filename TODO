Code:

* investigate the pwm code: https://www.electronicshub.org/esp32-pwm-tutorial/
* implement external ADC
* allow setting soft fuses + checking that with ADC
* allow storing of soft fuses + duty_cycle into FLASH
* more error checking of input

Electronics:

* test code with leds on all pins
* test breadboarded mosfet circuit - opto vs npn transistor
* test and decide on ADC
* test and decide on current sensor
* start schematic and pcb design

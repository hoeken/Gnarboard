Electronics:

* test voltage divider to get bus voltage
* test code with leds on all pins
* test breadboarded mosfet circuit - opto vs npn transistor
* test and decide on current sensor
* start schematic and pcb design
  * add a row of breakout headers for testing
  * figure out if there's a common i2c and spi header
  * add a header for serial port
  * any i/o pins left over?

# Yarrboard

Pronounced yarrrrrrr * brd.

An open hardware project for digital switching on boats, or anywhere with 12v-24v systems.

The project is based around the amazing esp32 and currently consists of one board, an 8-channel mosfet driver.  With this board, you can control almost any DC load on your boat. There are future plans to design a relay board, an I/O board, etc.

Since it is based on the esp32, the main communication method is over WiFi using websockets.  This makes for very easy interfacing if you want to write your own scripts.  It also means that the user interface for setup, config, and control are very easy.  Just point your phone to the url of the board and you're good to go.

There is also a plugin for integration with SignalK, so you can have your data all in one place.  It supports two way comms, so you can use SignalK and Node-RED to turn your loads on or off.
